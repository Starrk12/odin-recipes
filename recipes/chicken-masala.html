        <p>Chicken tikka masala is a dish consisting of roasted marinated chicken chunks in a spiced sauce.</p>
        <p> The sauce is usually creamy and orange-coloured. The dish was popularised by cooks from South Asia living in Great Britain and is offered at restaurants around the world.</p>
        <h2>ingridients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>bone-in chicken pieces (breasts, legs, or a mix), skin removed</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons toasted ground cumin</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons toasted paprika</li>
            <li>1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, roughly mashed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup roughly chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems</li>
            <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken pieces on a cutting board flesh-side up. Score deeply at 1-inch intervals with a sharp knife. Place in a large rimmed baking dish.</li>
            <li>Combine cumin, paprika, coriander, turmeric, and cayenne in a small bowl and mix well. Set aside 3 tablespoons of spice mixture. Combine remaining 6 tablespoons spice mixture, 8 cloves garlic, 2 tablespoons ginger, yogurt, 1/2 cup lemon juice, and 1/4 cup salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Pour marinade all over chicken pieces, using hands to coat every surface. Cover loosely and refrigerate. Refrigerate and allow to marinate for at least 4 hours and up to 8, turning occasionally.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat butter or ghee in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until melted and foaming subsides. Add onions, remaining 4 tablespoons grated garlic, and remaining 2 tablespoons ginger. Cook, stirring frequently, until dark and beginning to char in spots, about 10 minutes. Add reserved spice mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and half of cilantro, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan with a spoon. Simmer for 15 minutes, then puree using a hand blender or by transferring to a tabletop blender in batches.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from bone using a sharp knife and cut into rough bite-sized chunks. Transfer chicken chunks to pot of sauce. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring frequently, until chicken is just cooked through, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining cilantro, then serve immediately with rice or Grilled Naan.</li>
